"""Literal icet/mchammer baselines for the Ising target, with timing.

Why literal mchammer rather than our numba samplers: the thesis benchmarks
DNFS against *what materials practitioners actually run*. A fast bespoke
engine would be either an unclaimed contribution or unexplained machinery, so
the reported baselines are mchammer's own ensembles; the numba scripts
(`scripts/vcsgc_mcmc_validation.py`, `mcmc/kawasaki.py`) remain as
independent cross-checks that would catch an embedding bug here.

The embedding (validated to ~1e-9 against exact enumeration): the 2D Ising
torus is a single-layer FCC-free cell with a 10-unit vacuum gap in z and a
pair cutoff strictly between 1 and sqrt(2), so icet sees exactly one
nearest-neighbour pair orbit (4 neighbours per site) and no spurious z-image
or second-neighbour bonds. With ECI = [0, -bias, -4*sigma] the total CE
energy of a configuration equals -log p̃(x) for

    log p̃(x) = sigma * x^T A x + bias * sum_i x_i,

and working in natural units (temperature 1, k_B 1) makes the Boltzmann
weight exp(-E/kT) = exp(-E) = p̃(x) — the sampler then targets our
distribution with no further conversion. Spin convention: Au = +1, Ag = -1.

Two ensembles, matching the two constraint legs:

* soft  -> ``VCSGCEnsemble``. mchammer's variance-constrained penalty enters
  the acceptance exponent as -kappa * N * (c + phi/2)^2; at kappa = lambda,
  phi_Au = -2 * c_target this equals our -lambda * d * (c - c_target)^2
  identically (N = d), giving std(c) = 1/sqrt(2*lambda*d).
* hard  -> ``CanonicalEnsemble``. Swap moves preserve composition exactly:
  the hard constraint is enforced by the move set, not a penalty — the
  practitioner counterpart of Kawasaki dynamics.

Timing discipline: ``wall_seconds_run`` times the MC loop alone (setup —
cluster-space construction, calculator build — is recorded separately and
must never be folded into per-sample cost). Statistical efficiency comes
from the Sokal integrated autocorrelation time on each observable trace, so
every runner reports seconds per *effective* sample: the only currency in
which a CPU MCMC sweep and a GPU amortised sampler can be compared honestly.
There is no NFE analogue for an mchammer sweep, so wall-clock carries the
whole comparison.

    """Canonical (non-local unlike-pair swap) chain recording full ±1 spin
    snapshots at an exact proposal interval — the mixing probe's non-local
    variant carrier. Differs from `run_canonical` in three ways:

    * explicit initial state: the supercell's symbols are set from
      ``initial_spins`` before the ensemble is built, so reference chains can
      be seeded IN a chosen phi mode (phase-separated left/right) rather than
      at a random slice point;
    * exact-interval snapshot capture: ``ensemble.run(snapshot_interval)`` is
      driven in a loop and the structure read back between calls — the
      simplest capture whose intervals are exact in trial steps (mchammer's
      trajectory observer is bypassed; its rows would also cost memory);
    * raw arrays + counters are returned instead of summary statistics: the
      probe's analysis stage owns burn-in and R̂ decisions, so nothing is
      discarded here.

    Site indexing: spin index i == atom index i of the D x D x 1 ``repeat``
    supercell. ASE's repeat enumerates the two in-plane lattice vectors
    lexicographically, so reading atom order as a row-major D x D flattening
    reproduces the torus adjacency exactly (neighbours are i±1 and i±D with
    wraparound); energy and both correlation observables are invariant to
    which in-plane axis plays "rows", and the phi half-split axis is
    self-consistent because the SAME indexing writes the initial state and
    reads every snapshot. A scrambled atom order would silently corrupt all
    spatial observables — which is why ``potential_per_snapshot`` (mchammer's
    own exactly-recomputed CE energy at each snapshot step) rides along: it
    must equal -sigma * x^T A x recomputed from the returned snapshots, and
    the probe's tests pin that equality.

    snapshots[k] is the state after k * snapshot_interval proposals
    (snapshots[0] = the initial state, matching the numba runners'
    record-at-top convention); the state after the final interval is not
    recorded. ``n_proposals`` must be a multiple of ``snapshot_interval``:
    acceptance is recovered from mchammer's per-interval ``acceptance_ratio``
    rows, and a trailing partial interval would silently undercount it.

    Returns a dict with ``snapshots`` (int8, [n_kept, d]), ``n_proposals``
    (read back from ``ensemble.step`` — the exact trial-step currency),
    ``n_accepted``, ``potential_per_snapshot``, ``composition_is_constant``,
    ``wall_seconds_setup`` and ``wall_seconds_run`` (setup — cluster-space and
    calculator construction — must never be folded into per-proposal cost).
